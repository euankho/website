        What are memes? Memes are images with funny jokes which widespread across the internet gaining popularity. It is defined as “an amusing or interesting item (such as a captioned picture or video) or genre of items that is spread widely online, especially through social media” (Merriam Webster Dictionary, n.d). Due to the nature of the internet, memes are often reposted and sometimes changed a bit by changing the text on the image, explaining situations which somehow relate to the image. Memes gain popularity through social media such as Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, etc. After gaining popularity, some websites create templates for making memes for people who need an easy way to create a meme. This causes a lot of memes with the same image but explaining different situations to exist. Due to the nature of memes, they have a lot of variety and new ones come everyday. New memes normally come from TV shows, anime, and some even from social media. Theoretically any image can become a meme if you format it correctly and give the correct text to explain a situation or a joke. Memes tend to be funny as they sometimes explain life situations in a funnier way than usual. This causes memes to be entertainment for some people.

        As memes are a source of entertainment, they will be likely known and sometimes recognized. This will cause an impact on society due to it being recognized. While not everyone looks at memes on a daily basis and even some people do not even know what memes are, it will still show an impact on society. Due to this, memes may leave either a good or a bad mark on the time period in society. While memes constantly update, not everyone will be updated with them. Memes constantly updates daily, weekly and sometimes monthly which makes them very easily left behind. Memes which stop showing signs of impact on society are called by the internet “dying memes”, as the term says, the meme is dying, trying to survive in the ocean of memes.

        Due to memes being widespread, they sometimes slip into our lives such as our speech and what we do. For an example, in 2014, there was the ice bucket challenge. The ice bucket challenge was very popular that year and raised over $115 million dollars for research in ALS (nytimes). This proves that some memes have good intentions and leave as something good that has happened in history. Yet, not all memes are good. Some memes such as stuffing your mouth with cinnamon powder can cause diseases and hurt your stomach, and other symptoms may appear. Due to this, we cannot say all memes are good. This case also applies on memes which are images and text. There is a saying, “What one person finds funny may be offensive to another”, and this saying definitely applies to memes. This is due to how some memes can be racist. Racist memes can be funny to the party it isn't toward but can be very offensive to the ones it is portraying. As of now, only some people post racist memes as they do not want a bad face on the internet and some of us who might post memes sometimes rethink if we should post it as sometimes it may be offensive. Yet, even with all this, I still think that memes are a good source of entertainment as it can fill free time easily and they are very easy to find.

        Proof there are bad memes are memes about president Donald Trump. The memes about him blew up around the time he was running for president (knowyourmeme). Most of his memes originated from his tweets about certain things. One of them being the validity of the birth certificate of barack obama (knowyourmeme). While most of these memes may be funny to us, the end user or viewer, we rarely ever put ourselves in his shoes. It probably makes him feel down and give bad emotions as people are making fun of him. This is the same as a person bullying someone else. While it might be entertaining for the bully and some audience, the person who is bullied and the other half of the audience finds it very rude and annoying.

        Memes also show up in our day to day speech, in conversations we sometimes bring up some memes such as “Yeah, This is Big Brain Time”, which is a meme which originated from one of a famous youtuber named markiplier’s video (knowyourmeme). There was a part about how he was joking about his amazing decision making in the video. After the meme became popular, it started becoming shorter to the phrase “Big brain” as a joke about someone's decision. For some people, mostly people who watch and keep up with memes, has used this phrase in real life to compliment and sometimes make fun of a person’s decision.

        These examples show that memes can leave a good and a bad mark in society depending on the context and people. Yet memes tend to keep smiles on peoples faces as they are mostly funny. Memes also relieves people that have stress also for the same reason. In the end there are much more positive factors and marks that memes leave rather than bad ones. Yet we cannot forget that even though memes leave a lot of positive factors it cannot leave a bad mark. Normally memes that are blatantly bad, they are dropped quickly but memes with do not seem to be bad normally will continue. Some of these memes may not hurt anyone except the one that is in the image or video. Yet because of the nature of the internet, people online, the ones who post videos and such are normally laid back about people hating and making fun of them. In this society it is considerably normal to be made fun and being hated. We cannot live in a world where there is no hate nor a world where no one makes fun of you as this is all human nature.

        In the end memes will probably continue to exist for the length of humanity as it is a source of entertainment, something that relieves us of stress, something to discuss, and something that constantly updates. All these factors help memes to continue to live on and reminds us that memes will always be a part of lives. They also prove that memes tend to leave a good mark on society. People might disagree but we cannot say someone is fully good. The same case applies to memes, not all memes can be categorized good but some of them are. This leaves us with the conclusion that even though memes can be bad they are mainly good.
